# 🎬 Netflix Clone - Day 1

Welcome to my **Netflix Clone** project! This repository is a part of my web development learning journey, where I build a responsive and visually appealing Netflix-inspired interface using **React** and **CSS**.

## 📅 Day 1 Progress

On Day 1, I focused on setting up the foundation of the project. Here's what I've done so far:

### ✅ Completed Tasks:
- 🔧 Set up the **project folder structure** with `components/`, `assets/`, and `pages/`
- 🎨 Created a **Hero Section** with a featured banner
- 🧭 Designed and styled the **Navbar**
- 🖼️ Added **background image and overlay effects** to the hero page
